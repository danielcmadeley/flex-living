**Why Critical**: Validates your key Zustand architectural improvement
- ✅ Filter state management and updates
- ✅ UI state (view modes, toasts, sidebar)
- ✅ Bulk action selection and execution
- ✅ Computed values and state consistency
- ✅ Concurrent updates and persistence

### 2. **API Route Tests (23 tests)**
**Why Critical**: This endpoint will be directly tested in assessment
- ✅ URL parameter parsing and validation
- ✅ Filter logic (status, type, rating, date)
- ✅ Response structure validation
- ✅ Statistics calculation logic
- ✅ Error handling scenarios
- ✅ Performance considerations

### 3. **Core Infrastructure (5 tests)**
**Why Critical**: Ensures testing environment works correctly
- ✅ Basic functionality validation
- ✅ Mock function behavior
- ✅ Async operation handling
- ✅ Environment configuration
