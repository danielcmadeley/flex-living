# Review Status Management System

## Overview

The Flex Living dashboard now includes a comprehensive review status management system that allows property managers to control which reviews are displayed on the public website. This system implements three status levels: **Published**, **Pending**, and **Draft**.

## Status Types

### üì¢ Published
- Reviews that are visible on the public website
- Fully approved and ready for public viewing
- These reviews appear in the public reviews feed at `/`

### ‚è≥ Pending
- Reviews awaiting manager approval
- Not visible on the public website
- Managers can review and decide to publish or move to draft

### üìù Draft
- Reviews that are hidden from public view
- May need editing, follow-up, or are inappropriate for public display
- Completely private to the management dashboard

## Features

- **Interface**: Dropdown selector for each review
- **Real-time Updates**: Status changes are immediately saved to the database
- **Visual Feedback**:

### 2. Status Filtering
